# ADBC Notary

 * ![raw](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/raw.svg)
 * Editor: Chris Gough
 * Contributors:


This document describes the Notary (NRY) specification, which provides an irrefutable
history of a specific "contract" (eg an invoice and it's status lifecycle), pegged to
a blockchain distributed ledger. This service supports dispute resolution and provides
the foundation platform for financial services such as debtor financing. Notarisation
also makes it possible for the business system to audit the reliability of any TAP
Gateway that it uses.


## Status

This spec is a requirement for consultation.

This specification aims to support the Australian Digital Business Council
[eInvoicing initiative](https://ausdigital.github.io), and is under active
development at
[https://github.com/ausdigital/notary](https://github.com/ausdigital/notary).
